      <p><em>Eloquent JavaScript</em> is a digital book providing a
      comprehensive introduction (tutorial) to the JavaScript
      programming language. Apart from a bookful of text, it contains
      plenty of example programs, and an environment to try them out
      and play with them.</p>

      <p>The book is aimed at the beginning programmer ―
      people with prior programming experience might also get
      something out of it, but they should not read chapters 2 to 5
      too closely, because most of the concepts discussed there will
      probably be nothing new to them. Do make sure you read the end
      of the first chapter, which has some essential information about
      the book itself.</p>

      <p>The book is <a
      href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">freely</a>
      available, and may be used (as a whole or in parts) in any way
      you see fit, as long as I am credited as the original
      author.</p>

      <p>A copy of the book for off-line reading can be downloaded as
      a <a href="Eloquent JavaScript.zip">zip file</a>, and a more
      easily printable version can be found <a
      href="print.html">here</a>.</p>
